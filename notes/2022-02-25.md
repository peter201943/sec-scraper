## Tasks
- [x] Improve Logging
- [ ] Improve Comments (Using `##` to indicate sections)
- [ ] Add PDF/HTML choosing
- [ ] Extract `update_workbook` into discrete functions
- [ ] Move some log.errors into exceptions

## Logging Details
- Should it be assumed everything is hosted under the same git repo?
- If so, should just the latest commit be used to indicate the version in a log?
- Consider that uncommitted variable values may be used (less technical users)
- (Therefore should also *not* attempt to reach out to git to grab the commit version from within the script)
- Should all the variables be written to the logfile?
- No, keep `secrets` out
