## Learning
- [x] [Scrapy for Beginners - A Complete How To Example Web Scraping Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4jtkzHhLzY&t=377s)
- [ ] [Intro To Web Crawlers & Scraping With Scrapy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALizgnSFTwQ)

## Code
- validity-checks (required modules)
- constants
  - doc-regex
  - dir-regex
  - temp-control-options (delete-in-progress, delete-on-complete, delete-on-exit, no-delete)
- generate `input.csv` (manual, in excel)
- make `dir_links.csv` from `input.csv`
- make `doc_links.csv` from `dir_links.csv`
  - get 10-k link from directory page (scrapy)
  - fix bad links
    - Bad: `https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1555280/000155528021000098/zts-20201231.htm`
    - Fix: `https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1555280/000155528021000098/zts-20201231.htm`
- download page
  - (and delete, depending on options)
- strip html from page
- search page
  - on `divers` found, grab leading 50 characters and trailing 50 characters (regex)
  - save to `stats.csv`
- cleanup (if set in options)

## Folder Layout
- `original.xlsx` (whatever file all this data came from)
- `input.csv` (direct export from excel) (user generates this)
- `temp/` (all intermediary generated files) (we generate this if not present)
  - `dir_links.csv` (`row_id,dir_link`)
  - `plain_links.csv` (`row_id,doc_link`)
  - `full_pages/`
    - `zts-20201231.htm`
  - `bare_pages/`
    - `zts-20201231.htm`
- `stats.csv` (final outputted file) (`row_id,sentence_count,sentences`)
- `final.xlsx` (optional (for the time being)) (copy and modify `original.xlsx` with the new info)

## Example Stats File 1
```csv
row_id,sentence_count,sentences
1,0,""
2,1,"We value diversity at XBO Incorporated."
3,2,"Diversity?\nWhy would we want diversity at Skynet?"
4,3,"Intradus Corporate successfully divested itself of 3 million liabilities last year alone.\nLong term strategies include diversification of assets, market analysis and research, diversity and equity studies, and other ancillary pursuits."
5,4,"Diversity studies last year indicate a lack of human life forms in active employment at this company.\nDiverse investment strategies have been considered.\nDiversity programs improved human-computer relations by 300%.\nDiversity efforts at Ants Inc are likely to continue into the future."
6,5,"Diversity of assets were expanded in the last fiscal year following our general plan of diversification enhancement as laid out in section 12 of DBB's 2020 Corporate Plan.\nDiverse and talented individuals are sought to improve foreign relations.\nDiversity of mind can often be accompanied by diversity of circumstance."
```
- Ok, so Excel 2010 does not recognize `\n` ("Newline Escape Characters") as newlines
- Instead, must literally embed a newline character into the text (breaking the CSV)
- This is allowed, though it does make parsing ugly
- So I will treat this as a final export step
- See [Example Stats File 2](#example-stats-file-2) for actual result

## Example Stats File 2
```csv
row_id,sentence_count,sentences
1,0,""
2,1,"We value diversity at XBO Incorporated."
3,2,"Diversity?
Why would we want diversity at Skynet?"
4,3,"Intradus Corporate successfully divested itself of 3 million liabilities last year alone.
Long term strategies include diversification of assets, market analysis and research, diversity and equity studies, and other ancillary pursuits."
5,4,"Diversity studies last year indicate a lack of human life forms in active employment at this company.
Diverse investment strategies have been considered.
Diversity programs improved human-computer relations by 300%.
Diversity efforts at Ants Inc are likely to continue into the future."
6,5,"Diversity of assets were expanded in the last fiscal year following our general plan of diversification enhancement as laid out in section 12 of DBB's 2020 Corporate Plan.
Diverse and talented individuals are sought to improve foreign relations.
Diversity of mind can often be accompanied by diversity of circumstance."
